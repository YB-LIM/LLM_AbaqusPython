# Writting Abaqus python with Chatbots

Test Prompt (One shot): Write a python script to generate 3D solid part with a dimension of 5x5x50 in Abaqus/CAE

# Responses
**HuggingChat:**

Here is an example Python script that creates a 3D solid part with dimensions 5x5x50 in Abaqus/CAE:
<br><br>(Contents in the HuggingChat.py)<br><br>
This script defines a 3D solid part using a rectangular profile extruded along the z-axis by d. The resulting part has dimensions of w x h x d, where w and h are both set to 5 and d is set to 50. It also sets up basic material properties for the part and saves it as a CAE file called "solid_part.cae". Note that you will need to have Abaqus installed on your computer to run this script.

**ChatGPT3.5:**

To create a 3D solid part with dimensions of 5x5x50 in Abaqus/CAE using Python scripting, you can utilize the Abaqus Python API. Below is a script that accomplishes this:
<br><br>(Contents in the ChatGPT3p5.py)<br><br>
This script creates a new model named "MyModel" and a new part named "MyPart" with a dimensionality of three-dimensional deformable body. It defines the vertices and cells (hexahedral elements) required to create a solid part with dimensions of 5x5x50. Finally, it generates the mesh and saves the model as a .cae file.

Make sure you have Abaqus installed and properly set up with Python scripting capabilities to run this script.

**ChatGPT4:**

Creating a 3D solid part in Abaqus/CAE involves using Python scripting to automate the process within the Abaqus environment. The script I'll provide below is meant to be run inside Abaqus/CAE's Python scripting interface. This script will create a 3D solid part with dimensions of 5x5x50 units. To use this script, you should have Abaqus/CAE installed and some basic familiarity with running scripts in its environment.

Here's a step-by-step Python script for creating a 3D solid part:
<br><br>(Contents in the ChatGPT4.py)<br><br>
Steps to Run the Script in Abaqus/CAE:
1.Open Abaqus/CAE: Start the Abaqus/CAE software.
2.Open the Script Editor: In Abaqus/CAE, go to File > Run Script.
3.Load and Run the Script: Copy the provided Python script into the script editor or load the script file if you've saved it beforehand. Then, execute the script.
The script will create a new model named "SolidPartModel" and within it, a 3D solid part named "SolidBlock" with the specified dimensions of 5x5x50 units. If you want to see the part in the viewport, make sure to navigate to the part module and select the created part after running the script.

This script also includes optional steps to seed the part for meshing and generate the mesh, which might be necessary for simulation purposes. Adjust the mesh size and other parameters as needed for your specific requirements.

**GeminiPro1.0:**

I'd be glad to help you with that! Here's a Python script that generates a 3D solid part with dimensions 5x5x50 in Abaqus/CAE:
<br><br>(Contents in the GeminiPro1p0.py)<br><br>
his script performs the following steps:

1.Imports necessary modules: Imports the abaqus and mdb modules, which provide access to Abaqus/CAE functionality.<br>
2.Creates a model: Creates a new model named MyModel.<br>
3.Creates a block: Creates a solid block part named Block-1 with dimensions 5x5x50.<br>
4.Creates a sketch: Creates a sketch named Sketch-1 on the XY plane of the block.<br>
5.Draws a rectangle: Draws a rectangle in the sketch with dimensions 5x5.<br>
6.Extrudes the sketch: Extrudes the sketch along the Z-axis by 50 units to create the final solid part.<br>
7.Saves the model: Saves the model as MyPart.cae.<br>

To run this script:

1.Make sure you have Abaqus/CAE installed and running.<br>
2.Create a new Python script file (e.g., generate_solid_part.py) and paste the code into it.<br>
3.In Abaqus/CAE, go to Tools > Python Interpreter.<br>
4.In the Python interpreter window, type:<br>

Python
exec(open('generate_solid_part.py').read())
This will execute the script and create the solid part in your model.

Remember to adjust the script settings (e.g., part name, block dimensions) as needed for your specific requirements.
